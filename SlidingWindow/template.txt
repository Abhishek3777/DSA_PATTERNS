1. Sliding window

Traditional must do
A. 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
→ Track the longest substring with unique characters.

Sum related
B. 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
→ Min length subarray with sum ≥ target.

No hashing, intuitive and asked in Campus
C. Max Consecutive Ones 3

Key Concept used
D. 992. Subarrays with K Different Integers
→ Use the formula:
subarrays with exactly K = atMost(K) - atMost(K - 1)

// Slight change and different from traditional sliding window such as A. 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
E.424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
→ Max length substring where you can replace at most k characters.
F. Fruit into baskets 


Template for variable

int l = 0;
int r = 0;

while(r < s.size()){
// expand window with nums[right]

while(condition not met){
// shrink window from left
left++;
}
// Process or update result like maxLen or whatever and increase r
}
